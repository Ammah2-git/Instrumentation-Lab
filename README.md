The field of
electronic Instrumentation has seen major
innovations throughout the last twenty years
among which is the ultrasonic sensor. This device
allows us to detect the presence of an object
through the calculation of the distance incurred. It
essentially sends an ultrasonic signal from its
emitter and gets back its reflection through the
receiver. The time taken for the signal to travel
from the emitter to the receiver is then used to
approximate the distance with an appropriate
calibration.
We decided to use this clever device to create an
automatic car braking system to be installed in
commercial vehicles in order to improve the
general road safety.
